# Telecom AI Observability Platform

This repository marks the restart of my career as a Cloud & AI Platform Architect.

I am designing and building a production-grade, cloud-native observability platform for telecom environments.

Key goals:
• Microservice architecture (Spring Boot / FastAPI)  
• Kafka based ingestion pipelines  
• Kubernetes / OpenShift deployment  
• Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager observability  
• AI-powered log & metric intelligence  
• Auto-remediation workflows  

Status: ACTIVE BUILD (2026)
